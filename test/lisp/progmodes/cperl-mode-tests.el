(defmacro cperl--run-test-cases (file &rest body)
  "Run all test cases in FILE with BODY.
This macro helps with tests which reformat Perl code, e.g. when
indenting or rearranging flow control.  It extracts source code
snippets and corresponding expected results from a resource file,
runs BODY on the snippets, and compares the resulting buffer with
the expected results.

Test cases in FILE are formatted like this:

# -------- NAME: input --------
Your input to the test case comes here.
Both input and expected output may span several lines.
# -------- NAME: expected output --------
The expected output from running BODY on the input goes here.
# -------- NAME: end --------

You can have many of these blocks in one test file.  You can
chose a NAME for each block, which is passed to the 'should'
clause for easy identification of the first test case that
failed (if any).  Text outside these the blocks is ignored by the
tests, so you can use it to document the test cases if you wish."
